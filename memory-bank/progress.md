# Project Progress: Sneaky Link

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial planning phase**. We have established the architecture, defined the requirements, and outlined the technical approach. No code has been implemented yet.

## What Works

As the project is in the planning phase, there are no working components yet. The following has been accomplished:

1. **Project Documentation**
   - Project brief created
   - Product context defined
   - System architecture designed
   - Technical stack selected
   - Active context established

2. **Planning**
   - High-level architecture defined
   - Component boundaries established
   - Integration points identified
   - Technical decisions documented

## Known Issues

As the project is in the planning phase, there are no code-related issues yet. However, several challenges have been identified:

1. **Bitrefill UI Stability**
   - The stability of Bitrefill's UI for automation purposes is unknown
   - Changes to their UI could break automation
   - Need to implement robust selectors and fallback mechanisms

2. **Blockchain Confirmation Times**
   - ZCash and NEAR transaction confirmation times could affect user experience
   - Need to implement appropriate feedback and status updates

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Complex flow with multiple potential failure points
   - Need comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies

4. **Testing Complexity**
   - Testing browser automation and blockchain interactions is challenging
   - Need to create reliable test environment and mocks

## Next Milestones
